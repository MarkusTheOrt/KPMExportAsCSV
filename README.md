# KPM-Export-As-CSV

---

Allows you to convert Kaspersky Password Manager passwords as CSV.

Since KPM doesn't really allow to export in a readable format to import into other Password-managers, I made one here. You simply paste the contents of your exported txt into the text-box and click on submit.
